# Hello-World
me learning repository formats

I'm not so new to computers. However I haven't done any programming or html work since around 1996-1999. 
I took a simple Q-basic class in high school, and programmed some html on early version of Geo-Cities.
That is what I'm trying to get back. A Certain Style of programming and a Certain Mental Frame or attitude.

So, Hello World... Da Ja Hao!
